What is Habit vs Fear you say? What does it even mean? I have pondered this myself many times since beginning this journey 10 years ago. To sum up the core mission statement or elevator pitch (whichever way you lean) it is:

> Make an big effort every day to overcome your fears big or small and convert that worry, stress and anxiety into healthly habits, giving you power and control of your life and making you a happier, healthier person.

Easy to say, and hard to even quantify I know, I did say 10 years remember? There are so mnay slogans, banners and inspirational statements to go along with such a broad idea, but that's the core. The goal of this site is to share the ideas and concepts I have developed over time to help others in the same situations. By no means do I have all the answers so I will be learning along the way too as every day brings new challenges and possibilities.

I am Australian born and having lived in various countries during my life I'm now currently based in the UK.
